    <h1>About this site</h1>
    <b-row class="">
      <p>
        This is a personal site. Just as you like to keep your stuff neat and organized,
        much in the same way, I like to keep the things in my head neat and organized.

        From childhood I have been fascinated by what life is all about.
        And this is an ongoing journey.
        The website has been created in the same spirit.
        <br>
        The site records not only what I have learned, but also what I want to learn!
        <br>
        I've used my Engineering learnings to create this website (using the modern technologies).
        See the code for this website on <a href="https://github.com/trexsatya/cupitor" target="_blank"> Github </a>.

    <h1>About me</h1>
    <b-row class="">
      <p>
        I am currently working as a Software Engineer.
        <br> This website tells a lot about me (the things I have been interested in, my thoughts etc).
        <br>
        I am not very passionate about anything.
        But I am curious and I want to pursue wisdom, a very simple and minimalistic lifestyle.
        My goal is to eliminate traces of ego (along with all related vices) from my head,
        and act out of pure energy and serve others if possible.
